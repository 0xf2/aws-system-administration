# Submitting an Idea or Correction

Corrections and additions to the Peccary Book need to be processed through the O'REILLY production chain to make it to publication. 
While we appreciate reports in any format including e-mail, Twitter, and carrier pidgeon, the best way to report a correction or make a suggestion in through the [Peccary Book's Errata page](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920027638).
