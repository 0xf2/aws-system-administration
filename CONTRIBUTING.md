# Submitting an Idea or Correction

Corrections need to be processed through the O'Reilly production chain to make it to publication. 
While we appreciate reports in any format including e-mail, Twitter, and carrier pidgeon, the best way to report a correction or make a suggestion in through the [Peccary Book's Errata page](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920027638).
