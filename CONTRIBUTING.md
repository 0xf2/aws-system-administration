# Submitting an Idea or Correction

Corrections to "AWS System Administration" need to be processed through the O'REILLY production chain to make it to publication. 
While we appreciate reports in any format including e-mail, Twitter, and carrier pidgeon, the best way to report a correction or make a suggestion in through the [Peccary Book's Errata page](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/errata.csp?isbn=0636920027638). Feel free to reference a code fork or pull request to clearly indentify the issue in your report, but the GitHub workflow will not be used for merging as we make edits in our Atlas repo first, and propagate out from there.
