# AWS System Administration

This repository tracks the code used by significant examples in the O'REILLY title "AWS System Administration", co-authored by yours truly with Mike Ryan and commonly known as the "Peccary Book". We provide this repository for your convenience, and we will strive to keep it current and up-to-date as AWS and our book evolve.
