# AWS System Administration

This repository tracks the code used by significant examples in the O'REILLY title [AWS System Administration](http://bit.ly/peccary-book), co-authored by yours truly and the awesome [Mike Ryan](https://github.com/mikery) â€” and commonly known as the "Peccary Book". We provide this repository for your convenience, and we will strive to keep it current and up-to-date as AWS and our book evolve.
